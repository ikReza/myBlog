> What is software testing?

It is defined as an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is defect free

> Types of software testing:

1. **Manual Testing:** done manually without the use of automated tools or applications available in the market.

2. **Autmation Testing:** is an automatic technique where the tester writes scripts by own and uses suitable software to test the software.

> What are the phases involved in Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?

Series of testing activties to conduct software testing.

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Qulity assurance team understands the requirements in terms of what will be testing and figure out the testable requirements.
2. **Test Planning:** The most important phase where all test strategies defined.Test manager is involved to determine the efforts and estimate the costs.
3. **Test Case Development:** Testing team write down the detailed test cases.They also prepare test data if needed. Once the test cases are ready, these are reviewed by the peer members
4. **Environment Setup:** This is an independent activity can be started parallely with Test Case Development.
5. **Test Execution:** Execute the test case and compare the actual results with expected results.
6. **Test Cycle Closure:** A document that gives the summary of the total STLC.

> What is the difference between white box, black box and grey box testing?

or,

> What are the different methods of testing?

1. **White Box Testing:**

   - conducts on internal logic of the program
   - programming skill is required
   - e.g. Unite Testing, Integration Testing

2. **Black Box Testing:**

   - conducts on functionality of the application whether it is working according to customer requirements or not.
   - programming skill is required
   - also known as System Testing

3. **Grey Box Testing:**
   - combination of white box and black box testing
   - tester has limited knowledge internal details of the program
   - e.g. Database Testing

> What are the different levels of testing?

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - focuses on the smallest element of the software design
   - It makes heavy usage of White Box Testing.
   - Let's think we have a calculator(module). We divided the module to different units/submodules for tesitng e.g. check addition is working, check start key is working etc. Here every submodules are working independently.
2. **Integration Testing**
   - in this phase, individual modules are combined and tested as a group.
   - done in 3 ways:
     - Big Bang Approach
     - Top Down Approach
     - Bottom Up Approach
3. **System Testing**
4. **Acceptance Testing**

> Explain defect/bug life cycle

It starts when defect is found and ends when the defect is closed, after ensuring it's not reproduced.
