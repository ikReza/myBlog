### TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model

1. **Physical layer:** It represents physical devices that interconnects computers. All about cabling, connecting and sending signals.

2. **Data link/network interface/network access layer:** responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communcate.

   - in this layer we introduce our first protocol
   - _e.g. Ethernet/Wi-Fi_

3. **Network/Internet layer:** allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.

   - _e.g. The most common network layer protocol - IP(Internet Protocol)_

4. **Transport layer:** sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data

   - _e.g. TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)/UDP(User Datagram Protocol)_

5. **Application layer:** _e.g. HTTP/SMTP_
